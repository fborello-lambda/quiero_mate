# How

Dependencies:
- Erlang
- Elixir and Phoenix

To start the app:
  - PROD: `MIX_ENV=prod make run`
  - DEV: `make run` 

To start the app for debugging:
  - Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  - Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

### Notes

- The code was mainly generated by:
  - `mix phx.gen.live` &rarr; for the main `Ronda` LiveView component.
  - `mix phx.gen.presence` &rarr; to create the `presence.ex` file.
  - `mix phx.gen.release --docker` &rarr; for the `Dockerfile`
    - It was slightly modified to run the ecto `migrations`.
